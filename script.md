2: is it done yet? 
3: no. no its not.
1: jane is updating the database instance, but it doesnt support SQL 99 so we need to try something simpler
2: waht? why didnt somebody try this out in the staging environment???
3: I DID. but for some reason the environment there is competely different than the one in production. theyre using MYSQL in staging!
2: but.... were not using MYSQL in production!
1: thats because what were using in production costs too much to use in staging as well.

2: its done..
3: good job everyone. its a good thing this was eso easy!
